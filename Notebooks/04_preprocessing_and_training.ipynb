    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "The real world data is incomplete, inconsistent, contains errors and/or outliers. Data Preprocessing helps to clean, format and organize the raw data. Training data is the data you use to train an algorithm or ML model to predict the outcome we design our model to predict. We split our data into 70/30. 70% is the train split to train the model and 30% test split to test/verify the model. So, now we gave Train dataset shape(193, 35) and test dataset shape (83,35). We drop 3 colums whose data type is string- Name, State, and Region.\n",

    "Our Train-test datasets are changing; to fix them we used random_state. Dummy regressor is useful as a simple baseline to compare with other regressor. Here, we compare the mean. There are many ways of assessing how good one set of values agrees with another, which brings us to the subject of metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient of determination, R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. R2=0 inducates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. R2=1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data. R2 is negative only when the chosen model doesn't follow the trend of the data so fits worse than a horizontal line. R2 is less appealing if we want an idea of how close our predictions are to the true values. Metrics that summarise the difference between predicted abd actual values are mean absolute error and mean swuared error.\n",

To convert this back to our measurement space, we often take the square root, and those are quite similar.\n",

We transform our train and test data such that its distribution will have mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1, we did it feature wise by using standard scaler’s fit method. Then by Linear  Linear regression analysis, we want predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values.  By using predict() function, we predict the labels of the data values on the basis of the trained model. It returns the labels of the data passed as argument based upon the learned or trained data obtained from the model. By accessing the model, we figure out the performance between train data set and test data set varies by ≈10%. We calculate the MAE function, and get average you'd expect to estimate a ticket price within $9 or so of the real price. This is much, much better than the $19 from just guessing using the average. \n",
